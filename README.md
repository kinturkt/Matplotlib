# Matplotlib

<b> Matplotlib is a python library used for creating interactive visualizations. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK </b> <br>

By visualizing the data, users can easily read the data which is presented. <br>

Various types of visualizations used in Matplotlib library are scatter chart, bar chart, pie chart, histogram etc. <br>

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. <br>
Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. <br>

Here, I have used python's matplotlib library with numpy library & various charts of this library with syntax are explained using different examples with the ouput.
Also I had tried to explain the main parameters of different charts. 

<br> I have also used 3D (three dimensional) figures using Matplolib. Some three-dimensional plotting utilities were built on top of Matplotlib's two-dimensional display, and the result is a convenient (if somewhat limited) set of tools for three-dimensional data visualization. three-dimensional plots are enabled by importing the mplot3d toolkit. Also, if we want to, we save the visualized image on our disk using matplotlib's savefig() method. Using 3 dimensional figuere makes it easy to distriute & visualize the data.
